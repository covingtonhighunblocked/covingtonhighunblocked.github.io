        <h2>To the first person who reaches this point, congratulations. You have succesfully finished the scavenger
            hunt,
            and will receive a permanent quote of your choosing on the homepage of the website, as well as $10 in cash.
            Contact me on snapchat @swaggersnipesv2 or email me at covingtonhighunblocked@gmail.com with a code you can
            find
            in the Chat Tab source code, the first element in the body, hidden from normal view of course.</h2>

        <h2>To anybody that gets here after the first, I want to say thank you. Your continued support and use of my
            site
            gives me the confidence to learn more than I would have otherwise. Ive said it before and Ill say it again,
            I
            appreciate you all so so much. Im sorry I havent been able to support the growing requests for more games,
            but
            as a student, Im busy with schoolwork and a job. You all deserve so much for giving me the high school
            experience I always wanted but never though I would come to fully realize in my own life. To the seniors
            that
            are leaving, Im rooting for the continued success in your futures, and absolute freedom from this building
            that you have been
            given
            now. I will see you all at graduation, and I'm proud of all of you. I hope you enjoyed completing this as
            much as I enjoyed creating it. Thank you for participating, truly.</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>For presumably the last time this school year, this is Jace, and I hope you all have an amazing day. Stay
            amazing Covington High &#10084</h2>
